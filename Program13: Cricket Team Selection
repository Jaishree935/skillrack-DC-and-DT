Cricket Team Selection 

Question:
There are two cricket teams with 6 players in each team to play world super six league. 
The program must accept the names N and the batting average A of 12 players (6 in each team) as the input. 
The selection committee decided to merge the two teams into a single team with 6 players by eliminating the players with the least batting average among the 12 players from the two teams. 
Then the players in the selected team must be sorted in descending order based on their batting average. 
Finally, the program must print the name and the batting average of all the players in the selected team as the output. 

Note: 
The batting average of all 12 players are always unique. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= Length of each player's name <= 20 2 <= A <= 75 

Input Format: 

The first six lines, each containing the names of the players and their batting average of the first team. 
The next six lines, each containing the names of the players and their batting average of the second team. 

Output Format: 
The first six lines, each containing the names of the players and their batting average of the selected team.
