Last Character - 

Last but one The program must accept a string S as the input. 
The program must print the characters from the last but one occurrence of the last character in S. 
If the last character occurs only once, the program must print -1 as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
2 <= Length of S <= 100 

Input Format: 
The first line contains S. 

Output Format: 
The first line contains the characters from the last but one occurrence of the last character in S or -1. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 
banana 
Output: 
ana 

Explanation: 
The last character in S is a. 
The characters from the last but one occurrence of a in S are ana. 
So ana is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 
skillrack 

Output: 
killrack 

Example Input/Output 3: 

Input: 
enter 

Output: 
-1


code:
  import java.util.Scanner;

public class LastButOneCharacter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read the input string
        String s = scanner.nextLine();
        scanner.close();

        // Get the last character of the string
        char lastChar = s.charAt(s.length() - 1);

        // Find the last but one occurrence of the last character
        int lastIndex = s.lastIndexOf(lastChar);
        int lastButOneIndex = s.lastIndexOf(lastChar, lastIndex - 1);

        // Print the result
        if (lastButOneIndex == -1) {
            System.out.println("-1");
        } else {
            System.out.println(s.substring(lastButOneIndex));
        }
    }
}
