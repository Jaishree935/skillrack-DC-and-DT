Nth Term - Even Product Series 

Question:
The program must accept two integers N and X as the input. 
The program must form a series of integers based on the following conditions. 
     - The 1st integer in the series is always 2 (1st even integer). If the 1st integer is greater than X, then it must be decreased by X. 
     - The 2nd integer in the series is equal to the product of the previous term and 4 (2nd even integer). If the 2nd integer is greater than X, then it must be decreased by X. 
     - The 3rd integer in the series is equal to the product of the previous term and 6 (3rd even integer). If the 3rd integer is greater than X, then it must be decreased by X. 
     - The 4th integer in the series is equal to the product of the previous term and 8 (4th even integer). If the 4th integer is greater than X, then it must be decreased by X. 
     - Similarly, the remaining integers are formed in the series. Finally, the program must print the Nth term in the series as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
    1 <= N <= 10 1 <= X <= 10^5 

Input Format: 
    The first line contains N and X separated by a space. 

Output Format: 
    The first line contains the Nth term in the above mentioned series. 

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 
4 40 

Output: 
24 
Explanation: 
Here N = 4 and X = 40. 
The 1st term in the series is 2, which not greater than 40. 
The 2nd term in the series is 8 (2*4), which is not greater than 40. 
The 3rd term in the series is 48 (8*6), which is greater than 40. So it is decreased by 40. So the 3rd term becomes 8. 
The 4th term in the series is 64 (8*8), which is greater than 40. So it is decreased by 40. So the 4th term becomes 24. 
Hence 24 (4th term) is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 5 48 
Output: 3312 
Explanation: 
Here N = 5 and X = 48. 
1st term = 2. 
2nd term = 8 (2*4). 
3rd term = 48 (8*6). 
4th term = 384 (48*8) -> 336 (384-48). 
   5th term = 3360 (336*10) -> 3312 (3360-48).



Code:

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner s= new Scanner(System.in);
    int a=s.nextInt();
    int b=s.nextInt();
    int k=0,l=2;
    long d=2;
    while(k<a){
            d=d*l;
            if(d>b){
                d-=b;
            }
            l+=2;
            k++;
    }
    System.out.print(d);
	}
}
