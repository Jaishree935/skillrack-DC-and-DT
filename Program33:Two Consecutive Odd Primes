Two Consecutive Odd Primes 

The program must accept an integer N as the input. 
The program must print the integers present between every two consecutive odd prime integers from 1 to N as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 5 <= N <= 10^5 

Input Format: 
The first line contains N. 
Output Format: 
The first line contains the integers present between every two consecutive odd prime integers from 1 to N. 

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 
20 
Output: 
4 6 12 18 
Explanation: 
The prime integers from 1 to 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19. 
4 is present between 3 and 5. 
6 is present between 5 and 7. 
12 is present between 11 and 13. 
18 is present between 17 and 19. 
Hence the output is 4 6 12 18 

Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 
43 
Output: 
4 6 12 18 30 42


Code:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
int isPrime(int n)
{
  for(int i=2;i<=sqrt(n);i++){
     if(n%i==0){
        return 0;
     } 
  }
return 1;
}
int main(){
   int n;
   scanf("%d",&n);
   for(int i=3;i<=n;i++){
      if(isPrime(i-1) && isPrime(i+1)){
          printf("%d ",i);
      }
  }
}
