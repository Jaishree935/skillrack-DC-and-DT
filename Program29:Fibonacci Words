Fibonacci Words 

The program must accept an integer N as the input. 
The program must print the first N Fibonacci words formed by repeating them in the same way as generating Fibonacci numbers. 
The first term in the Fibonacci words must be "a" and the second term in the Fibonacci words must be "b". 

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= N <= 25 

Input Format: 
The first line contains N. 

Output Format: 
The first line contains the first N Fibonacci words. 

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 6 
Output: 
a b ba bab babba babbabab 

Explanation: 
Here N = 6 and the first two terms in the Fibonacci words are "a" and "b". 
The 3rd term in the Fibonacci words is ba ("b" + "a"). 
The 4th term in the Fibonacci words is bab ("ba" + "b"). 
The 5th term in the Fibonacci words is babba ("bab" + "ba"). 
The 6th term in the Fibonacci words is babbabab ("babba" + "bab"). 
Hence the output is a b ba bab babba babbabab 

Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 9 
Output: 
a b ba bab babba babbabab babbababbabba babbababbabbababbabab babbababbabbababbababbabbababbabba

         sb.append(" ").append(next);
         s1=S2;
         S2=next;
     }
         System.out.print(sb.toString());
     
	}
}
