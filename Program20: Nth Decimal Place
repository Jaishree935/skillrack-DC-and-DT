Nth Decimal Place 

The program must accept three integers X, Y and N as the input. 
The program must print the integer present in the Nth decimal place right to the decimal point when X is divided by Y as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= X, Y <= 10^4 1 <= N <= 15 

Input Format: 

The first line contains X and Y separated by a space. 
The second line contains N. 

Output Format: 

The first line contains an integer representing the Nth decimal place right to the decimal point when X is divided by Y. 

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 
22 7 
12 
Output: 
7 

Explanation: 
Here X = 22 and Y = 7. 
The floating point value when X is divided by Y is given below. 3.1428571428571428571428571428571428... 
The value of N = 12. 
The integer present in the 12th decimal place right to the decimal point is 7. 
So 7 is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 
4 2 
1 
Output: 0


Code:
import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		//Your Code Here
      Scanner s= new Scanner(System.in);
      int x=s.nextInt();
      int y=s.nextInt();
      int n=s.nextInt();
      x=x%y;
      for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
          x*=10;
          x=x%y;
      }
      x*=10;
      x=x/y;
      System.out.print(x);
      
	}
}
